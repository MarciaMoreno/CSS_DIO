          <div class="box-texto">
               We hold onto the lies to feel free<br>
               So shackled by smiles, so empty<br>
               We're scared of the war so we've forgotten who we are<br>
               We've traded in hope for safety<br>
               We're raising the smoke<br>
               Insisting that we're all to tired to light the fire and shake the earth<br>
               <br>
               But if all we are is just machines<br>
               Then let's become a miracle and break free from these chains<br>
               We must be more than just machines<br>
               So let them hear our hearts<br>
               So let them hear our hearts<br>
               So let them hear our hearts<br>
               <br>
               Where will you run<br>
               When there's no place left for you to hide?<br>
               When you're faced with the flood<br>
               Will you stand for the future and swallow your pride?<br>
               Where will you run? Will you run?<br>
               <br>
               Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one<br>
               Who face the grain and<br>
               Screams at the top of my lungs!<br>
               I hope it'll prove you wrong.<br>
               <br>
               But if all we are is just machines<br>
               Then let's become a miracle and break free from these chains<br>
               We must be more than just machines<br>
               So let them hear our hearts<br>
               So let them hear our hearts<br>
               <br>
               Where will you run<br>
               When there's no place left for you to hide?<br>

               <br>
               If all we are is just machines<br>
               Then we must be the cogs inside the wheels of change<br>
               We must be more than just machines<br>
               We can't afford to hide, we must embrace the pain<br>
               <br>
               We must be more than just machines<br>
               We can't afford to hide, we must embrace the pain<br>
